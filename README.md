# rock-paper-scissors

## Odin Project First JS project

### Phase 1

I must nake a project (game) of rock-papper-scissors

The player will be playing against computer and will gt their input through the:

```window.prompt("text")```

function

All responses must happen in the:

```console.log()``` function as i have not learnt much about DOM manipuation




## Progress in Project

## Phase 1

i will first create my PseudoCode to get all the coreect steps i am going tot take to make this project

No styling is needed at the moment

I should store function invoking in variables
do not define all variables locally,

Parameters can be global variables !! 
Calling function more than ONCE makes makes its previous value get rewritten
##  Phase 2


# Challenges 

I struggled with knwing when to call a function and when i should not when using parameters and arguments


if i use function as argument i should not add "()" if it is in the parenthesis it will instantly call it out
